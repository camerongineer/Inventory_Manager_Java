# Inventory Management System
## Introduction
This is a Java desktop application that manages inventory for a manufacturing organization. It provides functionality for adding, modifying and deleting parts and products, and managing the inventory levels of each product. This application was developed for an assessment and can be used to showcase relevant skills in software design and development.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) and JavaFX SDK or Module
- Scene Builder
- NetBeans version 11.1 or later or IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)
## User Interface
The user interface of the application is based on a GUI Mockup. It is a JavaFX application that closely matches the organization of the GUI layout and contains all UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.) in each of the following GUI mock-up forms:

- Main form
